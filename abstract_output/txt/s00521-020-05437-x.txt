摘要：The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the fastest transmittable virus caused by severe acute respiratory syndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The detection of COVID-19 using artiﬁcial intelligence techniques and especially deeplearning will help to detect this virus in early stages which will reﬂect in increasing the opportunities of fast recovery ofpatients worldwide. This will lead to release the pressure off the healthcare system around the world. In this research,classical data augmentation techniques along with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN) based on a deeptransfer learning model for COVID-19 detection in chest CT scan images will be presented. The limited benchmarkdatasets for COVID-19 especially in chest CT images are the main motivation of this research. The main idea is to collectall the possible images for COVID-19 that exists until the very writing of this research and use the classical dataaugmentations along with CGAN to generate more images to help in the detection of the COVID-19. In this study, ﬁvedifferent deep convolutional neural network-based models (AlexNet, VGGNet16, VGGNet19, GoogleNet, and ResNet50)have been selected for the investigation to detect the Coronavirus-infected patient using chest CT radiographs digitalimages. The classical data augmentations along with CGAN improve the performance of classiﬁcation in all selected deeptransfer models. The outcomes show that ResNet50 is the most appropriate deep learning model to detect the COVID-19from limited chest CT dataset using the classical data augmentation with testing accuracy of 82.91%, sensitivity 77.66%,and speciﬁcity of 87.62%.
